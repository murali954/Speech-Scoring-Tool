Nirmaan AI Case Study – Speech Scoring Tool
Automated Spoken Transcript Evaluation using Cohere Embeddings & NLP
📌 1. Problem Statement
Nirmaan Foundation required a tool to automatically evaluate students' spoken English introductions based on various quality metrics—such as clarity, structure, engagement, and content relevance.
Traditional evaluation by human instructors is:
Slow
Inconsistent
Not scalable
Requires constant manual effort
The goal is to use AI/ML to automate spoken transcript quality scoring.
📌 2. Objective
To build an AI-powered Speech Scoring Tool that evaluates a student’s introduction transcript and produces:
✔ Overall Score (0–100)
✔ Keyword Detection (name, age, class, hobbies, goals, etc.)
✔ Clarity Score (based on filler words)
✔ Engagement Score
✔ Semantic Similarity to ideal introduction
✔ Flow Score (salutation → intro → core → closure)
✔ Visual Score Breakdown using Plotly
✔ Easy-to-use Streamlit Interface
This ensures fast, consistent, and objective evaluation of students’ speaking performance.
📘 3. Approach & Implementation
### 3.1 Technology Stack
Component	Technology
Frontend	Streamlit
NLP	Cohere Embed Model (embed-multilingual-v3.0)
ML Metric	Cosine Similarity
Visualization	Plotly
Language	Python
Preprocessing	Regex, NumPy
### 3.2 Processing Flow
Step 1: Extract Text & Clean
Tokenize words
Convert to lowercase
Remove noise
Count total words
Step 2: Detect Key Information
Check for keywords like:
name, age, class, hobby, goals, family, interest, unique
Calculate keyword ratio = number of keywords found ÷ total keywords.
Step 3: Speech Flow Detection
Verify presence of:
Greeting (hello, hi, good morning)
Introduction (“my name is…”, “myself…”)
Core info (class, hobbies, family)
Ending (“thank you”)
Flow Score = segments_present / 4
Step 4: Clarity Scoring using Filler Words
If transcript contains words like:
um, like, you know, hmm, ah
Higher filler words → lower clarity.
Clarity = 1 – min(filler_rate / 12, 1)
Step 5: Semantic Similarity

Use Cohere embeddings to compare:

Student transcript vs Ideal introduction rubric

Ideal rubric:

“A structured spoken introduction including name, age, class, hobbies, goals and ending well.”

Cosine Similarity gives the semantic score.

Step 6: Weighted Score Calculation
Overall Score =
(0.45 × Content) +
(0.30 × Clarity) +
(0.25 × Engagement)

Step 7: Visualization

A colorful bar chart showing score breakdown

Detected keywords displayed with colored tags

JSON summary for debugging

🖥 4. User Interface (Streamlit)

The UI contains:

✔ Text area to paste transcript
✔ “Score” Button
✔ Overall Score with Progress Bar
✔ Bar Graph (Plotly)
✔ Keyword chips (green/red)
✔ Detailed numerical metrics

This UI is simple enough for:

Teachers

Students

NGOs / Skill Training Centers

📊 5. Output Example

Overall Score: 82/100
Semantic Similarity: 0.89
Flow Score: 0.75
Filler Rate: 3%
Keywords Detected: name, age, class, hobby, goals

Graph, keyword highlights, and JSON analysis appear immediately.
